# Plain and simple imagicks
I'm mostly using this repo for remote storage of my pics.

Basically none are made by me. Unless explicitally said otherwise.

I credit as can, and if I can't, please contact me at <alchemist.software@proton.me>.

I primarily save stuff related to Doom and western esoteric occultism.

The LICENSE refers only to what I make by myself, all else belongs to their respective creators as before.
